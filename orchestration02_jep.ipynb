       "This section provides an introduction to the Joint Engagement Plan (JEP) document, which outlines Oracle's approach to addressing Facetrom's needs using Oracle Cloud technology. The objective of this section is to give a brief overview of the content and objectives of the JEP document, highlighting the collaboration between Oracle and Facetrom to assess environment requirements, deliver architecture recommendations, and demonstrate the value of Oracle Cloud in achieving Facetrom's business objectives.\n",
       "\n",
       "The JEP document serves as a guide for both Facetrom and Oracle teams, providing an agreed-upon action plan to maximize the value of their collaboration.
