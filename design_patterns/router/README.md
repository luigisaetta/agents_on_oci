# Router
In this directory we show how we can implement a router using structured output from a LLM.
The model we're going to use is Llama 3.3 70B.

## Examples
In the notebook [Personal Assistant](./personal_assistant.ipynb) you find a full example of an Agent 
built using
* the **Router** pattern

The notebook shows how the agent manage the agenda, finding free slots in the calendar and setting meetings.
